examples illustrate payments on the notes linked to three hypothetical Reference Stocks assuming a range of performances for the hypothetical Least Performing Reference Stock on the Review Dates Each hypothetical payment set forth below assumes that the closing price of one share of each Reference Stock that is not the Least Performing Reference Stock on each Review Date is greater than or equal to its Strike Value and therefore its Interest Barrier and Trigger Value In addition the hypothetical payments set forth below assume the following a Strike Value for the Least Performing Reference Stock of 10000 an Interest Barrier and a Trigger Value for the Least Performing Reference Stock of 5000 equal to 5000 of its hypothetical Strike Value and a Contingent Interest Rate of 850 per annum payable at a rate of 2125 per quarter The hypothetical Strike Value of the Least Performing Reference Stock of 10000 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual Strike Value of any Reference Stock The actual Strike Value of each Reference Stock is the closing price of one share of that Reference Stock on the Strike Date and is specified under Key Terms Relating to the Reference Stocks in this pricing supplement For historical data regarding the actual closing prices of one share of each Reference Stock please see the historical information set forth under The Reference Stocks in this pricing supplement Each hypothetical payment set forth below is for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual payment applicable to a purchaser of the

Payment 117000 1700 return Because the notes have not been automatically called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Stock is greater than or equal to its Trigger Value the payment at maturity for each 1000 principal amount note will be 112750 or 1000 plus the Contingent Interest Payment applicable to the final Review Date plus the unpaid Contingent Interest Payments for any prior Interest Review Dates When added to the Contingent Interest Payments received with respect to the prior Review Dates the total amount paid for each 1000 principal amount note is 117000 Example 3

apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term or until automatically called These hypotheticals do not reflect the fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary

significant risks These risks are explained in more detail in the Risk Factors sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement and product supplement Risks Relating to the Notes Generally YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES MAY RESULT IN A LOSS The notes do not guarantee any return of principal If the notes have not been automatically called and the Final Value of any Reference Stock is less than its Trigger Value you will lose 1 of the principal amount of your notes for every 1 that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Stock is less than its Strike Value Accordingly under these circumstances you will lose more than 5000 of your principal amount at maturity and could lose all of your principal amount at maturity PS4 Structured Investments Auto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Common Stock of CVS Health Corporation the Common Stock of Merck  Co and the American Depositary Shares of Novartis AG THE NOTES DO NOT GUARANTEE THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND MAY NOT PAY ANY INTEREST AT ALL If the notes have not been automatically called we will make a Contingent Interest Payment with respect to a Review Date and we will pay you any previously unpaid Contingent Interest Payments for any prior Review Dates only if the closing price of one share of each Reference Stock on that Review Date is greater than or equal to its Interest Barrier If the closing price of one share of any Reference Stock on that Review Date is less than its Interest Barrier no Contingent Interest Payment will be made with respect to that Review Date You will not receive any unpaid Contingent Interest Payments if the closing price of one share of any Reference Stock on each subsequent Review Date is less than its Interest Barrier Accordingly if the closing price of one share of any Reference Stock on each Review Date is less than its Interest Barrier you will not receive any interest payments over the term of the notes CREDIT RISKS OF JPMORGAN FINANCIAL AND JPMORGAN CHASE  CO Investors are dependent on our and JPMorgan Chase  Cos ability to pay all amounts due on the notes Any actual or potential change in our or JPMorgan Chase  Cos creditworthiness or credit spreads as determined by the market for taking that credit risk is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes If we and JPMorgan Chase  Co were to default on our payment obligations you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and you could lose your entire investment AS A FINANCE SUBSIDIARY JPMORGAN FINANCIAL HAS NO INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS AND HAS LIMITED ASSETS As a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase  Co we have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of our securities Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase  Co substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of our affiliates to make payments under loans made by us or other intercompany agreements As a result we are dependent upon payments from our affiliates to meet our obligations under the notes If these affiliates do not make payments to us and we fail to make payments on the notes you may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase  Co and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase  Co THE APPRECIATION POTENTIAL OF THE NOTES IS LIMITED TO THE SUM OF ANY CONTINGENT INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT MAY BE PAID OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES regardless of any appreciation of any Reference Stock which may be significant You will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Stock YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF ONE SHARE OF EACH REFERENCE STOCK Payments on the notes are not linked to a basket composed of the Reference Stocks and are contingent upon the performance of each individual Reference Stock Poor performance by any of the Reference Stocks over the term of the notes may result in the notes not being automatically called on a Review Date may negatively affect whether you will receive a Contingent Interest Payment on any Interest Payment Date and your payment at maturity and will not be offset or mitigated by positive performance by any other Reference Stock YOUR PAYMENT AT MATURITY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE LEAST PERFORMING REFERENCE STOCK THE BENEFIT PROVIDED BY THE TRIGGER VALUE MAY TERMINATE ON THE FINAL REVIEW DATE If the Final Value of any Reference Stock is less than its Trigger Value and the notes have not been automatically called the benefit provided by the Trigger Value will terminate and you will be fully exposed to any depreciation of the Least Performing Reference Stock THE AUTOMATIC CALL FEATURE MAY FORCE A POTENTIAL EARLY EXIT If your notes are automatically called the term of the notes may be reduced to as short as approximately three months and you will not receive any Contingent Interest Payments after the applicable Call Settlement Date There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the notes at a comparable return andor with a comparable interest rate for a similar level of risk Even in cases where the notes are called before maturity you are not entitled to any fees and commissions described on the front cover of this pricing supplement YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ON ANY REFERENCE STOCK OR HAVE ANY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY REFERENCE STOCK THE RISK OF THE CLOSING PRICE OF ONE SHARE OF A REFERENCE STOCK FALLING BELOW ITS INTEREST BARRIER OR TRIGGER VALUE IS GREATER IF THE PRICE OF ONE SHARE OF THAT REFERENCE STOCK IS VOLATILE PS5 Structured Investments Auto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Common Stock of CVS Health Corporation the Common Stock of Merck  Co and the American Depositary Shares of Novartis AG LACK OF LIQUIDITY The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange Accordingly the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price if any at which JPMS is willing to buy the notes You may not be able to sell your notes The notes are not designed to be shortterm trading instruments Accordingly you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity THE FINAL TERMS AND VALUATION OF THE NOTES WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE PRICING SUPPLEMENT You should consider your potential investment in the notes based on the minimums for the estimated value of the notes and the Contingent Interest Rate Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest POTENTIAL CONFLICTS We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the notes In performing these duties our and JPMorgan Chase  Cos economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes It is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our affiliates in connection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the notes declines Please refer to Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest in the accompanying product supplement Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES WILL BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE PRICE TO PUBLIC OF THE NOTES The estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors The original issue price of the notes will exceed the estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes These costs include the selling commissions the projected profits if any that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes See The Estimated Value of the Notes in this pricing supplement THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES DOES NOT REPRESENT FUTURE VALUES OF THE NOTES AND MAY DIFFER FROM OTHERS ESTIMATES See The Estimated Value of the Notes in this pricing supplement THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES IS DERIVED BY REFERENCE TO AN INTERNAL FUNDING RATE The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the marketimplied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase  Co or its affiliates Any difference may be based on among other things our and our affiliates view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase  Co This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes See The Estimated Value of the Notes in this pricing supplement THE VALUE OF THE NOTES AS PUBLISHED BY JPMS AND WHICH MAY BE REFLECTED ON CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE THENCURRENT ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES FOR A LIMITED TIME PERIOD We generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period See Secondary Market Prices of the Notes in this pricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period Accordingly the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by JPMS and which may be shown on your customer account statements SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL LIKELY BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE OF THE NOTES Any secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because among other things secondary market prices take into account our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and also because secondary market prices may exclude selling commissions projected hedging profits if any and estimated hedging PS6 Structured Investments Auto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Common Stock of CVS Health Corporation the Common Stock of Merck  Co and the American Depositary Shares of Novartis AG costs that are included in the original issue price of the notes As a result the price if any at which JPMS will be willing to buy the notes from you in secondary market transactions if at all is likely to be lower than the original issue price Any sale by you prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL BE IMPACTED BY MANY ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS The secondary market price of the notes during their term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors which may either offset or magnify each other aside from the selling commissions projected hedging profits if any estimated hedging costs and the prices of one share of the Reference Stocks Additionally independent pricing vendors andor third party brokerdealers may publish a price for the notes which may also be reflected on customer account statements This price may be different higher or lower than the price of the notes if any at which JPMS may be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market See Risk Factors  Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes  Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors in the accompanying product supplement Risks Relating to the Reference Stocks NO AFFILIATION WITH ANY REFERENCE STOCK ISSUER We have not independently verified any of the information about any Reference Stock issuer contained in this pricing supplement You should undertake your own investigation into each Reference Stock and its issuer We are not responsible for any Reference Stock issuers public disclosure of information whether contained in SEC filings or otherwise RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NONUS COMPANIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ADSs OF NOVARTIS AG The ADSs of Novartis AG have been issued by a nonUS company  Investments in securities linked to the value of such nonUS equity securities involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those nonUS equity securities CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK WITH RESPECT TO THE ADSs OF NOVARTIS AG Because the ADSs of Novartis AG are quoted and traded in US dollars on the New York Stock Exchange and the ordinary shares of Novartis AG are quoted and traded in Swiss francs on the SIX Swiss Exchange fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Swiss francs and the US dollar will likely affect the relative value of the ADSs and the ordinary shares of Novartis AG in the two currencies and as a result will likely affect the market price of the ADSs of Novartis AG trading on the New York Stock Exchange  These trading differences and currency exchange rates may affect the market value of the notes and whether the closing price of one share of the Reference Stock on any relevant day will fall below the Interest Barrier and Trigger Value  The Swiss franc has been subject to fluctuations against the US dollar in the past and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future  Previous fluctuations or periods of relative stability in the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the US dollar are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations or periods of relative stability in that rate that may occur over the term of the notes  The exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the US dollar is the result of the supply of and the demand for those currencies  Changes in the exchange rate results over time from the interaction of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in Switzerland and the United States including economic and political developments in other countries  Of particular importance are rates of inflation interest rate levels the balance of payments any political civil or military unrest and the extent of governmental surpluses or deficits in Switzerland and the United States all of which are in turn sensitive to the monetary fiscal and trade policies pursued by Switzerland and the United States and other jurisdictions important to international trade and finance THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF THE ADSs OF NOVARTIS AG AND THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF THE ORDINARY SHARES OF NOVARTIS AG There are important differences between the rights of holders of the ADSs of Novartis AG and the rights of holders of the ordinary shares of Novartis AG which we refer to as the underlying stock  For example the issuer of the underlying stock may make distributions in respect of the underlying stock that are not passed on to the holders of the ADSs of Novartis AG  Any such differences between the rights of holders of the underlying stock may be significant and may materially and adversely affect the value of the ADSs of Novartis AG and as a result the notes THE ANTIDILUTION PROTECTION FOR EACH REFERENCE STOCK IS LIMITED AND MAY BE DISCRETIONARY The calculation agent will not make an adjustment in response

Federal Income Tax Consequences in the accompanying product supplement no 4I In determining our reporting responsibilities we intend to treat i the notes for US federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and ii any Contingent Interest Payments as ordinary income as described in the section entitled Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences  Tax Consequences to US Holders  Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons in the accompanying product supplement Based on the advice of Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP our special tax counsel we believe that this is a reasonable treatment but that there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially affected In addition in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the US federal income tax treatment of prepaid forward contracts and similar instruments The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment It also asks for comments on a number of related topics including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes possibly with retroactive effect The discussions above and in the accompanying product supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451b of the Code You should consult your tax adviser regarding the US federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the notice described above NonUS Holders  Tax Considerations The US federal income tax treatment of Contingent Interest Payments is uncertain and although we believe it is reasonable to take a position that Contingent Interest Payments are not subject to US withholding tax at least if an applicable Form W8 is provided it is expected that withholding agents will and we if we are the withholding agent intend to withhold on any Contingent Interest Payment paid to a NonUS Holder generally at a rate of 30 or at a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty under an other income or similar provision We will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld In order to claim an exemption from or a reduction in the 30 withholding tax a NonUS Holder of the notes must comply with certification requirements to establish that it is not a US person and is eligible for such an exemption or reduction under an applicable tax treaty If you are a NonUS Holder you should consult your tax adviser regarding the tax treatment of the notes including the possibility of obtaining a refund of any withholding tax and the certification requirement described above Section 871m of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder Section 871m generally impose a 30 withholding tax unless an income tax treaty applies on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to NonUS Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to US equities or indices that include US equities Section 871m provides certain exceptions to this withholding regime including for instruments linked to certain broadbased indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations Additionally a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871m instruments issued prior to January 1 2025 that do not have a delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay USsource dividends for US federal income tax purposes each an Underlying Security Based on certain determinations made by us we expect that Section 871m will not apply to the notes with regard to NonUS Holders Our determination is not binding on the IRS and the IRS may disagree with this determination Section 871m is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security If necessary further information regarding the potential application of Section 871m will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871m to the notes In the event of any withholding on the notes we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld The Estimated Value of the Notes The estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components 1 a fixedincome debt component with the same maturity as the notes valued using the internal funding rate described below and 2 the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market if any exists at any time The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the marketimplied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase  Co or its affiliates Any difference may be based on among other things our and our affiliates view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase  Co This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for

of the notes For additional information see Selected Risk Considerations  Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes  The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate in this pricing supplement The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs some of which are marketobservable and which can include volatility dividend rates interest rates and other factors as well as assumptions about future market events andor environments Accordingly the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time The estimated value of the notes does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others estimates Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes In addition market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect On future dates the value of the notes could change significantly based on among other things changes in market conditions our or JPMorgan Chase  Cos creditworthiness interest rate movements and other relevant factors which may impact the price if any at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions The estimated value of the notes will be lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers the projected profits if any that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes Because hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected or it may result in a loss A portion of the profits if any realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits See Selected Risk Considerations  Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes  The Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the

repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period These costs can include selling commissions projected hedging profits if any and in some circumstances estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and onehalf of the stated term of the notes The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection with our hedging
