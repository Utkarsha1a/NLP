There can be no assurance that the\\nperformance of the Index will result in a payment at maturity in excess of $1,000.00 per $1,000 principal amount note, subject to the\\ncredit risks of JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.\\n\\nHow the Notes\\nWork\\nUpside Scenario:\\nIf the Final Value is greater than the Initial Value,\\ninvestors will receive at maturity the $1,000 principal amount plus the Additional Amount, which is equal to $1,000 times the\\nIndex Return times the Participation Rate of 100.00% and which will not be greater than the Maximum Amount of $82.00 per $1,000\\nprincipal amount note. An investor will realize the maximum payment at maturity at a Final Value of 108.20% or more of the Initial Value.\\n\\n·If the closing level of the Index increases 5.00%, investors will receive at maturity a 5.00% return, or $1,050.00 per $1,000 principal\\namount note.\\n\\n·If the closing level of the Index increases 30.00%, investors will receive at maturity an 8.20% return, or $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal\\namount note, which is the maximum payment at maturity.\\nPar Scenario:\\nIf the Final Value is equal to the Initial Value or is\\nless than the Initial Value, the Additional Amount will be zero and investors will receive at maturity the principal amount of their notes.\\nThe hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments\\non the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term. These hypotheticals do not reflect the fees or\\nexpenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary market. If these fees and expenses were included, the hypothetical returns\\nand hypothetical payments shown above would likely be lower.\\nSelected\\nRisk Considerations\\nAn investment in the notes involves significant risks.\\nThese risks are explained in more detail in the “Risk Factors” sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement and product\\nsupplement.\\nRisks Relating to the Notes Generally\\n\\n·THE NOTES MAY NOT PAY MORE THAN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AT MATURITY — \\nIf the Final Value is less than or equal to the\\nInitial Value, you will receive only the principal amount of your notes at maturity, and you will not be compensated for any loss in value\\ndue to inflation and other factors relating to the value of money over time.\\n\\n·YOUR MAXIMUM GAIN ON THE NOTES IS LIMITED BY THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT,\\nregardless of any appreciation of the Index, which\\nmay be significant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPS-3\\n | Structured Investments\\nCapped Notes Linked to the S&P 500® Index\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n·CREDIT RISKS OF JPMORGAN FINANCIAL AND JPMORGAN CHASE\\xa0&\\xa0CO. — \\nInvestors are dependent on our and JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.’s\\nability to pay all amounts due on the notes. Any actual or potential change in our or JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.’s creditworthiness\\nor credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking that credit risk, is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes. If we\\nand JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co. were to default on our payment obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the\\nnotes and you could lose your entire investment.\\n\\n·AS A FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, JPMORGAN FINANCIAL HAS NO INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS AND HAS LIMITED ASSETS — \\nAs a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.,\\nwe have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of our securities. Aside from the initial capital contribution\\nfrom JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co., substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of our affiliates to make payments under\\nloans made by us or other intercompany agreements. As a result, we are dependent upon payments from our affiliates to meet our obligations\\nunder the notes. If these affiliates do not make payments to us and we fail to make payments on the notes, you may have to seek payment\\nunder the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co., and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured\\nand unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.\\n\\n·THE NOTES DO NOT PAY INTEREST.\\n\\n·YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ON THE SECURITIES INCLUDED IN THE INDEX OR HAVE ANY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THOSE SECURITIES.\\n\\n·LACK OF LIQUIDITY — \\nThe notes will not be listed on any securities\\nexchange. Accordingly, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which JPMS\\nis willing to buy the notes. You may not be able to sell your notes. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments.\\nAccordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity.\\nRisks Relating to Conflicts of Interest\\n\\n·POTENTIAL CONFLICTS — \\nWe and our affiliates play a variety of roles\\nin connection with the notes. In performing these duties, our and JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.’s economic interests are potentially\\nadverse to your interests as an investor in the notes. It is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our affiliates in\\nconnection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the notes declines. Please refer\\nto “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest” in the accompanying product supplement.\\nRisks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary\\nMarket Prices of the Notes\\n\\n·THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES IS LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE (PRICE TO PUBLIC) OF THE NOTES — \\nThe estimated value of the notes is only an estimate\\ndetermined by reference to several factors. The original issue price of the notes exceeds the estimated value of the notes because costs\\nassociated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include\\nthe selling commissions, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our\\nobligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. See “The Estimated Value of the Notes”\\nin this pricing supplement.\\n\\n·THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES DOES NOT REPRESENT FUTURE VALUES OF THE NOTES AND MAY DIFFER FROM OTHERS’ ESTIMATES —\\n\\nSee “The Estimated Value of the Notes”\\nin this pricing supplement.\\n\\n·THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES IS DERIVED BY REFERENCE TO AN INTERNAL FUNDING RATE — \\nThe internal funding rate used in the determination\\nof the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar\\nmaturity issued by JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our\\naffiliates’ view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management\\ncosts of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co. This\\ninternal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate\\nthe prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate\\nmay have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. See “The Estimated Value of the\\nNotes” in this pricing supplement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPS-4\\n | Structured Investments\\nCapped Notes Linked to the S&P 500® Index\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n·THE VALUE OF THE NOTES AS PUBLISHED BY JPMS (AND WHICH MAY BE REFLECTED ON CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS) MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE\\nTHEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES FOR A LIMITED TIME PERIOD — \\nWe generally expect that some of the costs included\\nin the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in\\nan amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. See “Secondary Market Prices of the Notes” in this\\npricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period. Accordingly, the estimated value of your notes during this\\ninitial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by JPMS (and which may be shown on your customer account statements).\\n\\n·SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL LIKELY BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE OF THE NOTES — \\nAny secondary market prices of the notes will\\nlikely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because, among other things, secondary market prices take into account our\\ninternal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and, also, because secondary market prices may exclude selling commissions,\\nprojected hedging profits, if any, and estimated hedging costs that are included in the original issue price of the notes. As a result,\\nthe price, if any, at which JPMS will be willing to buy the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if at all, is likely to be\\nlower than the original issue price. Any sale by you prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.\\n\\n·SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL BE IMPACTED BY MANY ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS — \\nThe secondary market price of the notes during\\ntheir term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors, which may either offset or magnify each other, aside from the\\nselling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, estimated hedging costs and the level of the Index. Additionally, independent\\npricing vendors and/or third party broker-dealers may publish a price for the notes, which may also be reflected on customer account statements.\\nThis price may be different (higher or lower) than the price of the notes, if any, at which JPMS may be willing to purchase your notes\\nin the secondary market. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes\\n— Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors” in the accompanying product supplement.\\nRisks Relating to the Index\\n\\n·JPMORGAN CHASE\\xa0&\\xa0CO. IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE UP THE INDEX,\\nbut JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co. will not\\nhave any obligation to consider your interests in taking any corporate action that might affect the level of the Index.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPS-5\\n | Structured Investments\\nCapped Notes Linked to the S&P 500® Index\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe Index\\nThe Index consists of stocks of 500 companies selected\\nto provide a performance benchmark for the U.S. equity markets. For additional information about the Index, see “Equity Index Descriptions\\n— The S&P U.S. Indices” in the accompanying underlying supplement.\\nHistorical Information\\nThe following graph sets forth the historical performance\\nof the Index based on the weekly historical closing levels of the Index from January 5, 2018 through May 5, 2023. The closing level of\\nthe Index on May 5, 2023 was 4,136.25. We obtained the closing levels above and below from the Bloomberg Professional®\\nservice (“Bloomberg”), without independent verification.\\nThe historical closing levels of the Index should\\nnot be taken as an indication of future performance, and no assurance can be given as to the closing level of the Index on the Observation\\nDate. There can be no assurance that the performance of the Index will result in a payment at maturity in excess of your principal amount,\\nsubject to the credit risks of JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.\\n\\nTax Treatment\\nThere is uncertainty\\nregarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes due to the lack of governing authority. You should review\\ncarefully the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” and in particular the subsection thereof entitled\\n“Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders — Notes with a Term of More than One Year — Notes Treated as Contingent Payment Debt\\nInstruments” in the accompanying product supplement no. 3-I. Based on current market conditions, we intend to treat the notes for\\nU.S. federal income tax purposes as “contingent payment debt instruments.” Assuming this treatment is respected, as discussed\\nin that subsection, unlike a traditional debt instrument that provides for periodic payments of interest at a single fixed rate, with\\nrespect to which a cash-method investor generally recognizes income only upon receipt of stated interest, you generally will be required\\nto accrue original issue discount (“OID”) on your notes in each taxable year at the “comparable yield,” as determined\\nby us, although we will not make any payment with respect to the notes until maturity. Upon sale or exchange (including at maturity),\\nyou will recognize taxable income or loss equal to the difference between the amount received from the sale or exchange and your adjusted\\nbasis in the note, which generally will equal the cost thereof, increased by the amount of OID you have accrued in respect of the note.\\nYou generally must treat any income as interest income and any loss as ordinary loss to the extent of previous interest inclusions, and\\nthe balance as capital loss. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Special rules may apply if the amount payable\\nat maturity is treated as becoming fixed prior to maturity. You should consult your tax adviser concerning the application of these rules.\\nThe discussions herein and in the accompanying product supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax\\naccounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code. Purchasers who are not initial purchasers of notes at their issue price should consult\\ntheir tax advisers with respect to the tax consequences of an investment in notes, including the treatment of the difference, if any,\\nbetween the basis in their notes and the notes’ adjusted issue price.\\nOur intended\\ntreatment of the notes as CPDIs will be binding on you, unless you properly disclose to the IRS an alternative treatment. Also, the IRS\\nmay challenge the treatment of the notes as CPDIs. If the IRS successfully challenges the treatment of the notes as CPDIs, then the notes\\nwill be treated as debt instruments that are not CPDIs and, would require the accrual of original issue discount as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPS-6\\n | Structured Investments\\nCapped Notes Linked to the S&P 500® Index\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nordinary interest income based on a yield to maturity higher than the\\ncomparable yield. Accordingly, under this treatment, your annual taxable income from (and adjusted tax basis in) the notes would be higher\\nthan if the notes were treated as CPDIs, and any loss recognized upon a disposition of the notes (including upon maturity) would be capital\\nloss, the deductibility of which is subject to limitations. Accordingly, this alternative treatment could result in adverse tax consequences\\nto you.\\nSection 871(m)\\nof the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 871(m)”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax (unless\\nan income tax treaty applies) on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments\\nlinked to U.S. equities or indices that include U.S. equities. Section 871(m) provides certain exceptions to this withholding regime,\\nincluding for instruments linked to certain broad-based indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations.\\nAdditionally, a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have\\na delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an\\n“Underlying Security”). Based on certain determinations made by us, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that Section\\n871(m) should not apply to the notes with regard to Non-U.S. Holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree\\nwith this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether\\nyou enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential\\napplication of Section 871(m) to the notes. \\nThe discussions\\nin the preceding paragraphs, when read in combination with the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”\\n(and in particular the subsection thereof entitled “— Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders — Notes with a Term of More than\\nOne Year — Notes Treated as Contingent Payment Debt Instruments”) in the accompanying product supplement, to the extent they\\nreflect statements of law, constitute the full opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP regarding the material U.S. federal income tax\\nconsequences of owning and disposing of the notes.\\nComparable\\nYield and Projected Payment Schedule\\nWe have determined\\nthat the “comparable yield” is an annual rate of 5.67%, compounded semiannually. Based on our determination of the comparable\\nyield, the “projected payment schedule” per $1,000 principal amount note consists of a single payment at maturity, equal to\\n$1,072.20. Assuming a semiannual accrual period, the following table sets out the amount of OID that will accrue with respect to a note\\nduring each calendar period, based upon our determination of the comparable yield and projected payment schedule. \\n\\n\\nCalendar Period\\nAccrued OID During \\nCalendar Period (Per \\n$1,000 Principal Amount\\n\\xa0Note)\\nTotal Accrued OID from Original \\nIssue Date (Per $1,000 Principal \\nAmount Note) as of End of \\nCalendar Period\\n\\nMay 10, 2023 through December 31, 2023 \\n$36.44\\n$36.44\\n\\nJanuary 1, 2024 through August 8, 2024 \\n$35.76\\n$72.20\\n\\n\\nThe comparable\\nyield and projected payment schedule are determined solely to calculate the amount on which you will be taxed with respect to the notes\\nin each year and are neither a prediction nor a guarantee of what the actual yield will be. The amount you actually receive at maturity\\nor earlier sale or exchange of your notes will affect your income for that year, as described above under “Tax Treatment.”\\nThe Estimated Value of the Notes\\n\\nThe estimated value of the notes set forth on the\\ncover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component\\nwith the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative or derivatives underlying\\nthe economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to\\nbuy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated\\nvalue of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by\\nJPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates’\\nview of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes\\nin comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co. This internal funding\\nrate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing\\nmarket replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an\\nadverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPS-7\\n | Structured Investments\\nCapped Notes Linked to the S&P 500® Index\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nprices of the notes. For additional information, see “Selected\\nRisk Considerations — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — The Estimated Value\\nof the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate” in this pricing supplement.\\nThe value of the derivative or derivatives underlying\\nthe economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates. These models are dependent on inputs such as\\nthe traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which\\ncan include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market events and/or environments.\\nAccordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant\\nfactors and assumptions existing at that time.\\nThe estimated value of the notes does not represent\\nfuture values of the notes and may differ from others’ estimates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations\\nfor the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In addition, market conditions and other relevant factors\\nin the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the value of the notes could change significantly\\nbased on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.’s creditworthiness, interest\\nrate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in\\nsecondary market transactions.\\nThe estimated value of the notes is lower than the\\noriginal issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original\\nissue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, the projected\\nprofits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the\\nestimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market\\nforces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss. A portion\\nof the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers,\\nand we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits. See “Selected Risk Considerations — Risks\\nRelating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Lower Than the Original\\nIssue Price (Price to Public) of the Notes” in this pricing supplement.\\nSecondary\\nMarket Prices of the Notes\\nFor information about factors that will impact any\\nsecondary market prices of the notes, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices\\nof the Notes — Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors” in the accompanying\\nproduct supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be\\npartially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial\\npredetermined period. These costs can include selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and, in some circumstances, estimated\\nhedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances. This initial predetermined time period is\\nintended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the stated term of the notes. The length of any such initial period reflects\\nthe structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection with our hedging activities, the estimated costs\\nof hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates. See “Selected Risk Considerations —\\nRisks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and\\nWhich May Be Reflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited\\nTime Period” in this pricing supplement.\\nSupplemental\\nUse of Proceeds\\nThe notes are offered to meet investor demand for products\\nthat reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the notes. See “Hypothetical Payout Profile” and “How\\nthe Notes Work” in this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile of the notes and “The Index”\\nin this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.\\nThe original issue price of the notes is equal to the\\nestimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, plus (minus) the\\nprojected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes,\\nplus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPS-8\\n | Structured Investments\\nCapped Notes Linked to the S&P 500® Index\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nValidity of the Notes and the Guarantee\\n\\nIn the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as\\nspecial products counsel to JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co., when the notes offered by this pricing supplement\\nhave been issued by JPMorgan Financial pursuant to the indenture, the trustee and/or paying agent has made, in accordance with the instructions\\nfrom JPMorgan Financial, the appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master global note that represents such notes\\n(the “master note”), and such notes have been delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such notes will be valid and\\nbinding obligations of JPMorgan Financial and the related guarantee will constitute a valid and binding obligation of JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.,\\nenforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights\\ngenerally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good\\nfaith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith), provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to (i) the effect of fraudulent\\nconveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above or (ii) any provision of the\\nindenture that purports to avoid the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law by limiting\\nthe amount of JPMorgan Chase\\xa0&\\xa0Co.’s obligation under the related guarantee.
